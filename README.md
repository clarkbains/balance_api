# Balance API
This api aims to help multiple people share expenses. For example, instead of having one person buy something, and then have people pay back, it would allow the cost to be split among x ways, and be a balance on everyones account. Then if a certain person is owed money later, it will cancel out.

Overall it just aims to reduce the number of transactions.

The backend will be hopefully be done as a proper php backend, and the frontend will come later as another repository.
